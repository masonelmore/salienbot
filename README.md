SalienBot will play the 2018 Steam Summer Sale minigame so you don't have to.

## Getting Started
* Install Python >= 3.6 https://www.python.org/getit/
* `$ git clone https://github.com/masonelmore/salienbot.git`
* `$ cd salienbot`
* `$ pip install requests`
* Get your token from https://steamcommunity.com/saliengame/gettoken.
